                Being around family and friends while roasting marshmellows in the cold weather sounds like a pleasant holiday night 
                for most of us. Fires such as these fall under the controlled fires category.
                Contolled fires are good - they provide warmth, light, and means for cooking food among other things.
                 But what happens when things start to become <span class="headingHighlight">uncontrolled?</span> 
                 <br/><br/>
                 A recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on 
                 Climate Change has determined that dramatic and rapid changes to the global economy are required in order to
                  avoid increasing climate-related risks for natural and human systems.
                <br/><br/>
                Through our visualizations, we aim to tell the truth about the status quo with regard to wildfires in the
                 United States of America. First, we present aggregated national data through many separate visualizations, 
                 each with lightweight interactions, to give the user an overview of the data. Then, we present a visualization
                  with many interactions to enable the user to drill down and explore the data by state. Finally, we guide the 
                  user to resources they could use to make a difference.

                The total area burned of US fluctuates from year to year, but the overall trend is <span class="headingHighlight">upward</span>. 
                The data seems to fluctuate periodically, with widespread fires occurring every year or two.<br/>
                From 1992 to 2015, fires were mainly concentrated in the <span class="headingHighlight">West</span> and <span class="headingHighlight">South</span>, and the fire area was also relatively large. 
                Such as Texas, California, Alaska, and Idaho.
                The western and southern states account for a very large share of the total area burned in the United States.<br/>

                    This visualization helps to understand the distribution of fires at different classes and the number of fires at different classes. 
                    The fire level is divided into 7 levels, from A to G, representing the area burned from small to large. 
                    The linear distribution cannot perfectly show the distribution of fire size classes and the number of fires at each class, 
                    since the area burned of class A is extremely small and the area burned of class G is extremely large.  
                    Therefore, we decided to use log (base 10) to narrow the gap between A and G, so that we could better see the distribution of fires at different levels and how many they occurred.<br/>

                We used the whole data from 1992 to 2015 to plot this scatterplot. 
                Each point in the plot represents a fire event, with different colors representing its class. 
                The horizontal axis is the date it occurred, and the vertical axis is its acres burned. 
                We can clearly see that as fires grow in size, the occurrence of fires become less frequent (extremely dense at class A and B, more sparse at class F and G).
                Therefore, lower fire size classes tend to happen more often and higher fire size classes tend to happen less often.

                Different regions are disproportionately affected by wildfires.

                Western states tend to lose more land to fire on a yearly basis and spend more time fighting fires
                than their counterparts on the East Coast.  
                
                Southern states, on the other hand, have to contend with
                smaller yet more numerous fires.  
                
                While Midwest states seem relatively fire-free in comparison, many
                of those states, such as Michigan, are still losing upwards of 1,000 acres of land to fire every year.<br/><br/>

                What's more, states like Texas and Washington are observing an <span class="headingHighlight">increase</span>
                in the amount of land burned away by wildfires every year.  Other states, like Idaho and Oregon,
                are spending <span class="headingHighlight">more</span> time in recent years to contain fires.<br/><br/>
